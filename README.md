Numerical integration

Plot the function by using any software you master. Find the integration of � from� =−6to�=6by
1) Using the analytical approach
2) The trapezoidal rule
3) The multiple-application Trapezoidal Rule, divided into 6 segments with equal length4) Simpson’s 1/3 rule
5) The multiple-application Simpson’s 1/3 Rule, divided into 6 segments with equal length6) Simpson’s 3/8 Rule
7) The combination of multiple-application Simpson’s 1/3 Rule and Simpson’s 3/8 Rule, wheretheintegration span is divided into 9 segments with equal length. Write a Python code to compute the seven problem above
